    <p> <em> <b>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac (January 9, 1856–1914) was a Serbian composer and music educator. 
       <br>His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art.</b> </em> <br> <br></p>
        <h2> <mark>Biography</mark></h2>
            <p>He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section <br> of the University of Belgrade. 
            In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef <br>Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class
            of Parisotti,in 1884. <br> <br>Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.<br>             
            From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. 
            Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the <br> conductor of the Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir). 
            From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade <br> high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing.<br> <br>
            Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school <br> in 1899 - <strong><em>Serbian Music School in Belgrade.</em></strong>
        
            He remains the director of this school until his death. Today the school <br>bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far 
            unwritten folk songs.
            Stevan Mokranjac<br> died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58.
            Every year, the town of Negotin organizes a music <br> festival in his honor called Mokranjčevi dani (Days of Mokranjac). The town also has a Mokranjac museum. <br> <br></p> 
                    <h2> <mark>Works</mark></h2>
                <p>His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his <br> work.
                     His most famous pieces are the <strong>fifteen Rukoveti</strong> (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches") - a collection <br> of songs and music (orchestral suites) 
                     based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, <br> Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. <br>
                    <br> His other prominent folk-based works include <strong>Primorski napjevi (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.</strong> <br>
                      A significant number of his works were made for church services. <br>Such as the <strong>Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog 
                      (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), </strong> <br> from which the <b>Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic hymn) </b>is most famous. 
                     Another two famous religious pieces are <br> <strong> Boga hvalim (Te Deum) and Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava).</strong></p>
